# Projekttitel.: Gender_Name_API
Description.: This small Program determines, based on the desired input in form of a name, the gender of said name. Using an Gender-API free to use coming with a free licence, limited to 200 uses per day.

Used a httpRequest to get the Jsondata from the online server, to display on a basic website, everything written in c#, html, css.
I can safely say that Rider as a coding platform the best choice is.

The biggest challenge actually was getting everything on github. xD followed by trying to extract the gender from the jsonstring in a function with Task<Result>.
